<p>This repository contains the research paper, <strong>"Multi-Head Attention Based LSTM Model for Forecasting Bangladeshi Stock Market Prices"</strong>, which was presented at [Conference Name] (if applicable). The paper introduces a novel multi-head attention and LSTM-based architecture for forecasting stock prices in the Bangladeshi stock market.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Forecasting stock prices is crucial for investment and risk management. This study proposes a multi-head attention and LSTM-based architecture to improve stock price predictions by combining the sequential capabilities of LSTM with attention mechanisms. The model is applied to datasets from six major Bangladeshi banks, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.</p>

  <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proposed model combines LSTM and multi-head attention to capture contextual dependencies in stock market data.</li>
        <li>The model outperforms traditional models such as LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM across multiple evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2 scores).</li>
        <li>Datasets from six Bangladeshi banks (Islami Bank, Dhaka Bank, AB Bank, Bank Asia, EBL, and City Bank) are used for evaluation.</li>
        <li>The attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant information, improving forecasting accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Financial forecasting</li>
        <li>Risk assessment</li>
        <li>Investment strategy formulation</li>
        <li>Applicable to emerging markets with complex financial dynamics</li>
    </ul>
